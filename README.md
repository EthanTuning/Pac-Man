# Pac-Man
My implementation of the classic game of Pac Man. This is written in Java using JavaFX.

To play game:

1. Download java (if you don't have it) at https://java.com/en/download/
2. Navigate to Pac-Man/dist/
3. Download Pac-Man.jar to your desktop
4. Double click the .jar
5. Enjoy!

There are two levels, and a easter egg :) There are also some bugs in the game. The main one is with the sounds. I HIGHLY SUGGEST you turn down the volume on your computer when you play. The sounds are very loud at the moment and distorted.
